% Create a movie with a bouncing ball;
%
% bouncingBallMovie()

% Changes:
% 1. 3 balls
% 2. all are initially moving diagonally, bottom-right, 1 column and 1 row
% per frame
% 3. 32 rows, 29 cols
% 4. 200 iterations
% 5. Balls' initial coors: (5, 2), (21, 1) and (9, 26)
% 6. Hole 2x2 pixels big, top-left at coor (16,14), diff color from ball
% and bg
% 7. balls reach hole => balls disappear
% 8. assume balls never collide
